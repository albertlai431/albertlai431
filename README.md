## Hi there 👋

I'm an CS undergrad at UWaterloo! My goal is to create for impact — from a [mobile app](https://www.trudeausac.com/app/) I built for my high school to a [chatbot](https://omdena.com/projects/ptsd/) that helps PTSD victims around the world find treatment for their condition. My background is in data but I've been dabbling in fullstack over the past year, working at Shopify, [UW Blueprint](https://uwblueprint.org/) and [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com/)! On the side, I enjoying running 🏃‍♂️, playing piano, reading, and having conversations with cool people (like yourself 😉).

### What I'm Currently Working On
- Interning at Faire as a backend developer
- Hardware hacking
- Brainstorming startup ideas
