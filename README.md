## Hi there 👋

I'm an CS undergrad at UWaterloo! My goal is to create for impact — from a [mobile app](https://www.trudeausac.com/app/) I built for my high school to a [chatbot](https://omdena.com/projects/ptsd/) that helps PTSD victims around the world find treatment for their condition. My background is in data but I've been dabbling in fullstack over the past year! On the side, I enjoying running 🏃‍♂️, playing ultimate, reading, and sitting around contemplating life 🤔

### What I'm Currently Working On
- Interning at Shopify as a backend developer
- Building [Canada's largest hackathon](https://hackthenorth.com/)
- Learning Ruby on Rails
