## Hi there 👋

I'm a grade 12 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau HS and an incoming CS 👨‍💻 undergrad! My goal is to create for impact — from a [mobile app](https://www.trudeausac.com/app/) I built for my high school to a [chatbot](https://omdena.com/projects/ptsd/) that helps PTSD victims around the world find treatment for their condition. I'm experienced in C++, Python (Pytorch/Tensorflow) & Java, and I'm currently learning React & Gatsby! On the side, I enjoying running 🏃‍♂️, playing ultimate, reading, and sitting around contemplating life 🤔

### What I'm Currently Working On
- Add new features to [pethsapp](https://www.trudeausac.com/app/) 📱 — including a Chinese localization and calendar notifications
- Working on a computer vision application for [Neurofit VR](https://neurofit.ca/) 🧠
- Revamping my personal website with Gatsby
