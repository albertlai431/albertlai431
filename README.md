## Hi there 👋

I'm an CS undergrad at UWaterloo! My goal is to create for impact — from a [mobile app](https://www.trudeausac.com/app/) I built for my high school to a [chatbot](https://omdena.com/projects/ptsd/) that helps PTSD victims around the world find treatment for their condition. I'm experienced in C++, Python (Pytorch/Tensorflow) & Java, and I'm currently learning React & Gatsby! On the side, I enjoying running 🏃‍♂️, playing ultimate, reading, and sitting around contemplating life 🤔

### What I'm Currently Working On
- Building a portal for [Sistering](https://sistering.org/) as a part of [UW Blueprint](https://uwblueprint.org/)
